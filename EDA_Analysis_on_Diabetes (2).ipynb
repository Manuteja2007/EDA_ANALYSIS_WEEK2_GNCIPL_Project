This project addresses the critical need for a proactive, data-driven approach to diabetes risk assessment. By leveraging clinical and demographic data, the problem is to identify the most significant predictive factors of diabetes and develop a reliable machine learning model that can accurately stratify individuals based on their risk, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes."

The concentration of higher glucose values seems to increase slightly with more pregnancies, suggesting gestation may influence glucose metabolism.

This pattern indicates that while pregnancies may be a contributing factor, it is not the sole predictor of elevated glucose levels."

        "This scatterplot reveals a critical clinical relationship: higher glucose levels strongly correlate with diabetes diagnosis (colored points). The data shows a positive trend where elevated BMI often coincides with hyperglycemia, particularly in diabetic cases. Notably, diabetic outcomes cluster prominently in the high-glucose quadrant, regardless of BMI. Non-diabetic cases predominantly occupy the normal glucose range across all BMI values. This visualization confirms glucose level as a primary biomarker, with BMI serving as a significant compounding risk factor for diabetes."

        "This stratified analysis shows that the relationship between glucose and blood pressure remains consistently weak across all BMI categories. There is no clear, strong correlation visible in any weight group—underweight, normal, or overweight. Diabetic outcomes are present at all levels of blood pressure, indicating it is not a primary distinguishing factor. The plot confirms that high glucose levels, not blood pressure, are the dominant predictor of diabetes, regardless of a patient's weight category. This suggests clinical focus should remain on glucose management over blood pressure for diabetes prediction."

The higher and wider box for the diabetic group means they not only have higher average sugar levels, but also more variation from person to person.
